To be used with the newer version of the Celer Routing Engine.  Currently there is no shortcut to open just the route, so this will need to be downloaded and opened with the editor.  

Navigate to https://celer.pistonite.org/edit in any web browser, then drag and drop the AKM folder into the editor window.  The route and map will show up on the right side of the page.
